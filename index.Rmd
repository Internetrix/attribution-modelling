The aim of this guide is to help marketing, business and analytics experts 
understand how to get the biggest impact from their marketing budget.  

Our focus is on marketing attribution. That is, the way in which we can measure
and assign credit to individual marketing channels, even when we are 
simultaneously advertising via many channels. Only by understanding this can
we generate meaningful estimates on the return we get from each channel and
therefore guide future spending decisions.  

When we say marketing, the main focus is on digital marketing. In this guide
we use Google Analytics and the Google Marketing Platform as the 
tools of choice. If you use some other digital analytics platform, you can 
still benefit from the content, but you will need to be a little more self-sufficient in 
exporting and preparing your data for analysis.  

Finally, for more advanced and customised methods we use the R statistical
programming language. These sections are aimed at data scientists and
data analysts with some experience with scripted analysis. Hopefully the 
basic examples shown in this guide will help in getting up to speed and generating
useful insights as quickly as possible.  

We hope you enjoy and get some benefit from this guide. If you have any 
feedback or comments, or would like to discuss working together, please reach
