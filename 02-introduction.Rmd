# Introduction

## What is attribution modelling

The ideal world for marketers is that customers will fall in love with your 
products or services and make a purchase the first time they see an advertisement. 
But, the truth is the customer might have hundreds of interactions with a 
brand before they make a purchase. Actually, they might get exposed to the 
products or services through different marketing channels such as social media,
other web sites, search engines and apps etc.

So why do we care about this? The ultimate aim is to arm decision makers with
the data needed to make complex decisions. We do this by measuring the return on 
investment (ROI) of marketing efforts. In Jayawardane et. al (2015) they discuss
how customers who interact with a brand across multiple channels bring in more
value. While it is typical to have parallel streams of marketing efforts, 
it is not straightforward to understand which of these channels actually helped make
the conversion and to what extent. 

We present a tour of methods that solve this problem with practical implementation
guides and code examples. We aim to give decision
makers the data to understand the true return from each channel and therefore
guide marketing strategy in a data driven way.  


## Definitions  

In this guide we talk about the 'customer pathway' or the 'conversion journey'. 
We define this as the sequence of steps a customer takes when interacting with a brand
which will ultimately lead to either the customer converting
or not converting.   

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/last_touch.png", dpi = 100)
```

We say *conversion* to mean the user has completed a desired action. This may 
indeed be purchasing an item from a website eStore, however in other domains
this may simply mean signing up to a service or newsletter or completing some
other pre-defined action. 


## Scope of this paper  

First we break down the types of models that solve this attribution problem in different ways. 

For each type of approach we present an explanation and a practical example 
of how they work as well as a review of their strengths and weaknesses.  

At Internetrix, we are accredited Google Partners and support clients with
tracking and optimising their online presence using tools from the Google
Marketing Platform. We review the existing methods that are available in 
tools like Google Analytics and Analytics 360. 

However, this guide is largely aimed at users who want to customise and extend
these methods and tailor them to their specific company goals. We present
a toolkit using the R programming language, complete with reproducible code examples
to showcase attribution modelling methods, from the very
basic to more complicated and powerful algorithms.  

In doing this, we use example data from Google Analytics 360 and BigQuery. We cover
the often neglected steps of how to query and prepare this data for modelling. However,
for users who collect their digital marketing data in other platforms, the 
implementation guides will still be relevant and valuable.  

Finally we extend attribution modelling in a bonus section to cover *offline* 
attribution. That is, measuring the impact of channels outside the digital sphere 
like TV, radio, billboard etc. This unlocks some powerful tools to extend 
beyond what is tracked from your website.
